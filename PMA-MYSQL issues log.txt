Using phpMyAdmin as a GUI app for MySQL gave me a number of issues.

1) The 'toggle-relationship lines' button was not working on phpMyAdmin designer.
	Went through a number of solutions online and
	one was adding adding 'pma__relation' to the
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation'] line in config.inc.php file
	file is located in xampp folder in htdocs or Local disk
		C:/xampp/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php
	https://stackoverflow.com/a/32002861

	This did not work for me though, I had to update phpMyAdmin.


2) After updating phpMyAdmin by downloading the zip file and replacing the contents in the
   phpMyAdmin folder in xampp. The 'toggle-relationship-lines' button was now working
   but the mouse cursor was awful in dragging the tables. It was frustrating.
	As usual, I took to the internet to figure out why and I fix found a
	fix. 
	Open the move.js file in notepad and edit a few things
	move.js is located in
		xampp/phpMyAdmin/js/src/designer
	change the '#page_content' to 'document' inside the
	DesignerMove.enablePageContentEvents function
	i.e before: 
			$('#page_content').off('mouseup');
    			$('#page_content').off('mousemove');
    			$('#page_content').on('mousedown', function (e)...
	     after:
			$('#page_content').off('mouseup');
    			$('#page_content').off('mousemove');
    			$(document).on('mousedown', function (e)...
	AND I SAVED, RESTARTED mysql in services and RELOADED the window and
	IT WORKED LIKE MAGIC.

3) Again (wahala no dey finish), I had another issue.
   After failed inserts into my db from my python program/script,
   the table was jumping values in the column that had the auto increment values.
   meaning, it created indexes [sic] for every entry into the table even though they failed.

	As I entered the query into the search bar, Google was already screaming that
	the issue was with auto_inc_lockmode for InnoDB (the database engine)
	I tried to understand the documentation MySQL put on this issue but 
	apparently I don't speak Cantonese.
	I picked that there were 3 modes:
		0 or traditional
		1 or consecutive &
		2 or interleaved.
	I understood a little and I tried to change my auto_inc_lockmode setting to 0
	To change the auto_inc_lockmode,
	once again, you edit a configuration file. for this issue,
	it's my.ini or my.cnf
	You can easily open this by clicking on config for MySQL in xampp or
	going to the xampp folder once again
		xampp/mysql/bin/
	you find a file named 'my'
	open it and scroll to the InnoDB settings and add
		innodb_autoinc_lock_mode = 0
	and save it, then restart MySQL.
	After I changed it to 0, it worked. It reset to normal but for some reason
	later, it started skipping values again.

	Finally, I found a final fix.
	Go to the table with the issue in phpMyAdmin and go to the Operations tab
	Here you'll find an AUTO_INCREMENT option and you can set it manually to the
	next number after the last index in the auto_increment column.
	Better still, you can sort it with an SQL query.
		ALTER TABLE nameOfTable AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
			
				 OR MORE EFFICIENTLY

		SET  @num := 0;

		UPDATE your_table SET `nameOfColumnwAutoInc` = @num := (@num+1);

		ALTER TABLE your_table AUTO_INCREMENT =1;

I'm facing an issue currently, I can't create view with the create view button but
I've not found a fix bc I don't have that time for now. It took hours and hours of
aggressively browsing the internet to find these things.
		
Also want to add that using '?' as placeholder variable for execute statements in
Python is throwing an error.
e.g
	cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = ?", (2,)) ❎
I had to use a s-format string
	cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = %s", (2,)) ✅
