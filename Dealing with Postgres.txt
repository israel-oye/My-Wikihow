!Always Restart the postgresql-x86 service after editing any *.conf file

1. 
(On Ubuntu) To switch to a postgres user:
$ sudo -i -u <postgres-username>
e.g
$ sudo -i -u postgres

2.
To change postgres user password, 
open pg_hba.conf file in Windows: `"C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\data\pg_hba.conf"` for Ubuntu:[refer to https://stackoverflow.com/a/76606645/16792256]
and change the following setttings 
From:
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256

To:
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust

Restart the postgresql-x86 service after editing the .conf file
This lets us login the postgres user to the postgres server without authentication.

In the psql shell, run the following:
postgres=# ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'OGBeks281';
ALTER ROLE

OR this
postgres=# \password
Enter new password for user "postgres":
Enter it again:

When done, don't leave the settings like that OBVIOUSLY. Change the `trust` back to `scram-sha-256` or any other.



3.
To create another database user:
After loggging in to psql as postgres user, run

postgres=# CREATE USER newusername WITH PASSWORD 'User-Password';
#The CL will show this below. Ignore it
CREATE ROLE.

Creating a user without attaching it to a database is virtually useless. We can't even login the user.
That's why immediately after, we should create a database

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE newdb WITH OWNER = newusername;
CREATE DATABASE


To login to a particular database, run
> psql -h localhost -d databasename -U myuser -p <port>
The port is usually 5432. To know the port, check the postgresl.conf in the
"C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\postgresql.conf" or 
/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf on Ubuntu

Run $ sudo nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf to edit on Ubuntu.



To access a database running on postgres on Windows in WSL, 
1. run `ipconfig` on Windows and look for the IPv4 address under Ethernet adapter vEthernet (WSL (Hyper-V firewall))
OR
On the Ubuntu instance, run  $ ip route | grep default to see the windows machine host IP.

Ensure the postgresql service is running on windows and on the WSL too.
To check if postgres is running on WSL ubuntu:
sudo systemctl status postgresql
Run sudo systemctl start postgresql if it is not running.

Now connect to the windows postgres database:
psql -h <ip-gotten-from-ipconfig> -d <database-name> -U <database-user> -p <port>
