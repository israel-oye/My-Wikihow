type 'python -m venv venv' in the terminal

VS Code should bring up a prompt sayting:
"We noticed a new virtual environment has been created. Do you want to selct it..."
choose "YES"

in the file explorer tab, it should show a 'venv' drop-down

if you don't see a '(venv)' in front of the line on the terminal, type in venv\scripts\activate

	if you see “running scripts is disabled on this system,”
	open the Windows PowerShell as an admin and type:
		"set-executionpolicy remotesigned"
	and select the appropriate option you want, which is "Y" for Yes and press Enter
	
	!!! SAFER OPTION !!!
	"set-executionpolicy -scope "currentuser" 
	It should show an ExecutionPolicy: prompt
	
	Type in Unrestricted as in
	ExecutionPolicy: Unrestricted

	go back to your terminal and type "venv\scripts\activate" again

you can now install any external library you want using 
	"pip install nameOfLibrary"

According to Microsoft Tech Support it might be a problem with Execution Policy Settings.
 To fix it, you should try executing "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process"
 (as mentioned in the comment section by @wtsiamruk) in your PowerShell window.
 This would allow running virtualenv in the current PowerShell session.

There is also another approach that is more unsafe, but recommended by MS Tech Support.
 This approach would be to use 
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force (which do unleash powers to screw Your system up).

 However, before you use this unsafe way, be sure to check what your current ExecutionPolicy setting is 
by using get-ExecutionPolicy.

Then, when you are done,
you can revert back to this ExecutionPolicy by using:
 Set-ExecutionPolicy %the value the get-ExecutionPolicy command gave you% -Force.
