## HOW AUTH WORKS

1. **You generate a secret key pair** (think lock and key).
2. You keep the **private key** safe on your computer.
3. You give GitHub your **public key**.
4. Every time you push, GitHub checks the key and lets you in silently. No password prompts!

# âœ… FULL SETUP GUIDE â€” SSH AUTH WITH GITHUB FROM SCRATCH

---

## âœ… STEP 1: Check for SSH Keys

See if you already have keys:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If you see files like `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have a key (skip to Step 4).

If not, go to Step 2.

---

## âœ… STEP 2: Generate a New SSH Key Pair

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* When prompted to save, hit **Enter** to accept default (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
* It may ask for a **passphrase** â€” enter one or leave it blank (your choice)

ðŸŽ‰ Now youâ€™ve created:

* `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` â†’ your **private key** (do not share)
* `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` â†’ your **public key** (youâ€™ll upload this to GitHub)

---

## âœ… STEP 3: Start the SSH Agent

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

This command starts the "key helper" in the background.

Then add your new key:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

---

## âœ… STEP 4: Add Your Key to GitHub

Copy the public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Youâ€™ll see something like:

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1... your_email@example.com
```

Now go to:

ðŸ”— [https://github.com/settings/ssh/new](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)

* **Title**: Call it "My Laptop" or "Work PC" â€” whatever
* **Key**: Paste the key you just copied

Then click **Add SSH key**.

## âœ… STEP 5: Tell Git to Use SSH Instead of HTTPS

If you cloned your repo like this:

```bash
https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

It uses HTTPS (asks for password).

Convert it to SSH:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
```

Or reclone it fresh using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
```

---

## âœ… STEP 6: Test That It Works!

Run:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see:

```
Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated...
```

ðŸŽ‰ Now you can push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

No password needed! No more prompts. Youâ€™re in.

# Recap

```bash
# 1. Generate key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"

# 2. Start agent and add key
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# 3. Add public key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub   # then paste at https://github.com/settings/ssh/new

# 4. Make sure your repo uses SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

# 5. Test & push
ssh -T git@github.com
git push origin your-branch
```

---

## ðŸš¨ Pro Tips

* Use `ssh-add -l` to see if your key is loaded
* Add this line to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to auto-start agent:

  ```bash
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ```
