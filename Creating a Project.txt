1.type "cmd" in the directory search bar of the folder where you want to create a project.

2.after the prompt has opened, type 
"dotnet new console -o NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT"

3. the CLI will show that the project has been created successfully.

4. type "cd NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT"

5. CLI will take you to to the directory of your project.

6. type "code ."
This will open your project in Visual Studio Code.

! dotnet 6.0 does not initiate a project with a Main method because of some changes. If you want one,
we have to create a new project using an older framework like dotnet 5 and previous.

Instead of using	 dotnet new console -o NameOfProject, you use:
			dotnet new console --framework net5.0 -o NameOfProject
